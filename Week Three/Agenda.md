####Assignment Midterm: Ideation, Target Audience, and Personas

#Midterm Project
##Description
You have been hired by ANI-WHERE (an imaginary scientific organization) to create a mobile Animal Tracker web app. You must design and present a beautiful and 
functional responsive web app in class, Week 7.

###IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

You will be required to produce ALL of the content from scratch, including any photography or custom images.
This will feature a custom map interface and the ability for the user to add where items where tracked.

###Step 1. Basic Brainstorming and Ideation

Select a single, specific species of mammal, bird, aquatic animal or insect.
This requires research. Consider that you may need to photograph this animal at a local zoo, aquarium, museum, or in the wild. 
You also need to know enough about the animal to determine whether it is going to be in your area at this time of year.

###Step 2. Target Audience & Personas

A. Identify and define your primary and secondary target user.  Include Personas.  Why do they need this mobile web application?

B. Describe their technology resources, for example, brand and size of mobile device and internet connectivity requirements.

C. Identify 3 TASKS your user will be able to accomplish with your application (Logging in doesn't count as a task)

###Step 3. Documentation
Create a written proposal (PDF) that explains the animal you choose, why it needs tracking, and your target audience.
