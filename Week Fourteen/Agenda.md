##Description

You and some collegues have created a company with the idea that an improved messaging app is the wave of the future.  Your idea is not 
new but you have seen that there are a number of issues with todays messaging systems.  For example:

-	People are used to using their current messaging app. So how will you get people to use your app instead of the one they are using now?
-	Messaging is a huge part of peoples lives everyday.  It does more than just allow us to communicate.  What features will you provide so that the user doesn't have to leave the app?
-	Current messaging apps are designed in a fairly standard way.  How will you design it so that it is unique?
