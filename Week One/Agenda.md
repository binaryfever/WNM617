####In Class Group Challenge
Occassionally in this course we will have in class challenges.  
You will work in groups to complete these challenges.  The challenges 
will be due by the end of the class.  You may turn them in incomplete as
they are not graded like an assignment.  They do however count towards
your particiattion grade. So they must be turned in.

This weeks challenge is to create a basic 4 or less page website.  It doesn't need to be fancy. 
It should have the following items:

1.	Navigation
2.	Header
3.  At least 1 images
4.	At least two paragraphs
5.	Footer
6.	Basic Styling (keep it simple)

The purpose of this challenge is to get your feet wet with HTML and CSS after the 
summer.  

####Assignment
Complete a market-share comparison of two mobile devices. Note that your
two devices must be from different companies (for example, iPhone vs. Windows Phone, or Android tablet vs. iPad). 
For each device, include items such as the market share, number of devices sold, number of users, and number of 
available native applications. 

Type out your findings in a report format in a PDF document.  Upload your assignment to the 
LMS.

Due Date: Before the beginning of the next class
